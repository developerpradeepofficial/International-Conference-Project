# International-Conference-Project Breast Cancer Classification Project

This project aims to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant using machine learning algorithms. The project was presented at the International Conference on Recent Innovations in Research, Industry, and Community (ICRIRCMS) organized by Mahsa University Malaysia and K.S Rangasamy College of Technology Tiruchengode in 2022.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which is publicly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 569 samples of breast cancer tumors, with 30 features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
# Methodology
The project used the following methodology:

1. Data preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned, missing values were handled, and the features were scaled.
2. Feature selection: The most important features were selected using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).
3. Model selection: Three machine learning algorithms were evaluated - Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest.
4. Model evaluation: The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
# Results
The Random Forest algorithm achieved the highest accuracy of 97.54%, with precision of 97.61%, recall of 96.77%, and F1-score of 97.19%.
# Conclusion
The results demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can effectively classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant. The Random Forest algorithm was found to be the most effective for this task, achieving a high accuracy and precision. This project has potential applications in medical diagnosis and treatment planning.
